PROJECT REPORT
Real-Time Bus Tracking System
________________________________________
1. Introduction
In modern urban transportation systems, real-time tracking plays a crucial role in improving commuter experience and operational efficiency. Traditional bus systems often suffer from delays, lack of transparency, and inaccurate arrival timings. To overcome these challenges, the Real-Time Bus Tracking System is designed to provide live bus location updates, route visualization, and Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) using GPS and mapping services.
This project enables passengers to track buses in real time while allowing administrators to manage routes and monitor vehicles efficiently.

2. Objectives of the Project
The main objectives of this project are:
•	To track buses in real time using GPS data
•	To display live bus locations on an interactive map
•	To calculate ETA based on distance and speed
•	To manage bus routes through an admin panel
•	To provide a scalable and REST-based backend system

3. Problem Statement
Public transportation users often face uncertainty regarding bus arrival times and routes. Manual tracking systems are inefficient and outdated. There is a need for an automated, real-time tracking solution that provides accurate and timely information to users.

4. Proposed Solution
The proposed system uses GPS-enabled buses, a backend server to process location data, and a frontend web application that displays real-time information on Google Maps. The system continuously updates bus positions and calculates ETA using distance-based algorithms.

5. Tech Stack Used
Frontend
•	React.js – For building dynamic and responsive user interfaces
•	Google Maps API – For map visualization, route plotting, and live tracking
Backend
•	Spring Boot – For building RESTful APIs
•	Java – Backend programming language
Database
•	PostgreSQL – For storing bus, route, and GPS data
________________________________________
6. System Architecture
The system follows a client-server architecture:
1.	GPS devices send real-time location data
2.	Backend APIs process and store the data
3.	Frontend fetches updates via REST APIs
4.	Google Maps API displays live bus movement
